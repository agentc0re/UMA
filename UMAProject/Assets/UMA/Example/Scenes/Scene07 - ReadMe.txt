The purpose of this Demo scene is to demonstrate one way of using UMA with multiplayer games.
Its not the only way, but an example on how it might look like.

Some things to note:
-You need to add the scenes to the player settings before playing.
-You star by running the "Scene07 - NetworkingMenu" scene.
-The current text based saving format is not ideal for networking since it takes up quite some space, 
 but making a better one is way out of scope for this Demo.
